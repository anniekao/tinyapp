# TinyApp - The URL Shortener

TinyApp is a clone of other popular URL-shortening websites such as bit.ly or owl.ly that has also incorporated registration and login features allowing for unique users with their own set of shortened URLS. This project was an exercise in learning backend routing by using Express on the server-side.

## Getting Started

Run ```npm install``` and then ```npm start```. TinyApp will be running on ```localhost:8000```.

## Running the tests

Tests are run with the help of ```mocha``` and ```chai```. 

Run ```npm test``` to get the test suite started.
